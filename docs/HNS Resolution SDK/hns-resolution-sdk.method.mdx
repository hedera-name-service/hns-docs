The HNS namespace currently includes `.hbar`, `.boo`, and `.cream` TLDs, which are native to HNS. Since the namespace will expand over time, a hardcoded list of TLDs for recognizing HNS names will regularly be out-of-date. The HNS Resolution SDK ensures a correct resolution of account holders and their domains.

## Name Resolution

Domains can have many types of data associated with them; the most common is cryptocurrency addresses, or Hedera Account IDs in the context of HNS.

### Installation

Install the SDK. There are no additional peer dependencies required at this time.

```
npm install @hedera-name-service/hns-resolution-sdk
```

### Initialization

Initialize the resolver by defining the API service you will use with the SDK. The SDK currently supports the following services:

- `hedera_main`: [Hedera Mainnet Public Mirror Node](https://docs.hedera.com/hedera/core-concepts/mirror-nodes/hedera-mirror-node#mainnet)
- `hedera_test`: [Hedera Testnet Public Mirror Node](https://docs.hedera.com/hedera/core-concepts/mirror-nodes/hedera-mirror-node#testnet)

:::info

Example to initialize resolver with `hedera_main`:

```javascript
import { Resolver } from 'hns-resolution-sdk';

const resolver = new Resolver('hedera_main');
```

:::

- `arkhia_main`: Hedera Mainnet Arkhia API Service
- `arkhia_test`: Hedera Testnet Arkhia API Service

:::info

Example to initialize resolver with `arkhia_main`:

```javascript
import { Resolver } from 'hns-resolution-sdk';

const resolver = new Resolver('arkhia_main', 'x-api-key', `${process.env.apiKey}`);
```

> **Note:** The example above demonstrates how to initialize the resolver with [Arkhia](https://arkhia.io). This is only for demonstration purposes and should not be implemented on any client side code. Always keep your API keys hidden!
