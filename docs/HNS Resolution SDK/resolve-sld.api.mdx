# Resolving domain names

Domains can have many types of data associated with them; the most common is cryptocurrency addresses, or in the context of Hedera, account IDs. HNS supports storing and resolving the account IDs from a given domain name, if associated.

## `Resolver.resolveSLD`

### Method:

`resolveSLD(domain: string): Promise<string | undefined>`

### Parameter: 

`domain: string`: Any valid string that could represent a domain name.

### Return:

`Promise<string | undefined>`: If the specified domain name resolves to an account ID, the account ID will be returned. If it does not resolve to an account ID, `undefined` is returned.

### Example:

```javascript
// Initialize the resolver
const res = await resolver.resolveSLD(`hns.hbar`)
// 0.0.838546
```
